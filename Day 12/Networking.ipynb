        "5. **Avoid “lock + join on other thread” patterns**: Waiting on other threads while holding a lock can form a circular dependency.\n",

        "6. **Favor higher-level concurrency constructs**: Use thread-safe queues, message passing, or single-threaded data-handling for shared state rather than heavy locking logic. Example: using `queue.Queue` to avoid many locks. ([Code Without Rules][5])\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "So, in Python, thread interruption is implemented by **cooperative cancellation** — one thread *requests* another to stop, and that thread *checks* for such a request periodically and stops itself gracefully.\n",
