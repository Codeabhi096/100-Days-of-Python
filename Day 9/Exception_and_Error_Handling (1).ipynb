        "\n",
        "A **nested try block** is when you have a `try…except…finally` (or just `try…except`) inside another `try`. In Python, this allows you to handle errors at different “layers” of your code — inner-block handles specific issues, outer block handles more general or fallback issues. According to a tutorial: *“In a Python program, if there is another try-except construct either inside either a try block or inside its except block, it is known as a nested-try block.”* ([TutorialsPoint][1])\n",
        "\n",
        "Why use it? Because sometimes you have an operation (outer) composed of sub-operations (inner) each of which may throw different exceptions and may require different handling. Nested blocks let you localize error handling. However: this can reduce readability and maintainability if overused. ([Software Engineering Stack Exchange][2])\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**What happens:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `a / b` triggers `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
        "* That is caught by the *inner* `except ZeroDivisionError`.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Things to note / caveats\n",

        "* Logging levels: default root logger level is WARNING, so DEBUG and INFO might not appear unless you change the level. ([Real Python][9])\n",
        "* Avoid heavy operations inside log message formatting when logging is disabled for that level (use lazy formatting or check level).\n",
        "* Don’t use `print()` for production-level diagnostics. Use logging so you can control verbosity, output destination, format.\n",
        "* For exception handling integration: in an `except` block you might log the error rather than just silent fail.\n",
        "* Over-logging or logging sensitive information can create its own issues (performance, disk use, info exposure).\n",

        "### Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use one logger per module: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.\n",
        "* Configure logging at entry point, not in libraries. Libraries should assume logging is set up.\n",
        "* Use appropriate levels: DEBUG for development detail, INFO for high-level events, WARNING for recoverable issues, ERROR for failures, CRITICAL for very severe.\n",
        "* Include contextual information (e.g., who, what, where) in log messages.\n",
        "* Use handlers and formatters for multi-destination logging (file, console, remote).\n",
        "* Use `logger.exception()` inside exception handlers (equivalent to `error(..., exc_info=True)`).\n",

        "* When you write `except SomeException:`, you catch that exception and its subclasses.\n",
        "* It is good practice to catch specific built-in exceptions rather than broad `except Exception:` or `except:`.\n",

        "* `ZeroDivisionError` – division / modulo by zero.\n",
        "* `TypeError` – operation or function applied to object of inappropriate type.\n",
        "* `ValueError` – built‐in function gets argument of right type but inappropriate value.\n",
        "* `IndexError` – sequence index out of range.\n",
        "* `KeyError` – mapping key not found.\n",
        "* `FileNotFoundError` – file or directory not found.\n",
        "* `ImportError` / `ModuleNotFoundError` – failed import.\n",
        "* `OSError` – system‐related errors (e.g., I/O errors).\n",
        "* `AssertionError` – raised when an `assert` fails.\n",
        "* `RuntimeError` – generic error when no more specific category fits.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Catch the most specific exception you expect. For example, `except IndexError:` rather than `except Exception:` if you know you’re indexing.\n",
        "* Avoid bare `except:` (which catches `BaseException`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, etc) unless you deliberately want to handle everything (often not advisable).\n",
        "* Use the exception’s attributes (like `.args`, `.__str__()`) to log or display meaningful information.\n",
        "* When you catch an exception you cannot handle properly, consider re-raising or converting to another exception or logging it.\n",
        "* Know the exception hierarchy: catching `Exception` will catch most regular errors but not system‐exit exceptions derived from `BaseException` (e.g., `KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`) which often should not be suppressed.\n",
