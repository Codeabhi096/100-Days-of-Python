        "\n",
        "### What is OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Object‐Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where you model your program around **objects** rather than just procedures or functions. An object bundles **data** (attributes/properties) and **behaviour** (methods/functions) together. In Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. ([Real Python][1])\n",
        "* An **object** (or instance) is a concrete realization of that blueprint. ([nustat.github.io][2])\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key pillars of OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "In many OOP languages (including Python), we often refer to four main pillars:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation** – bundling data and methods together, hiding internal state. (Though Python doesn’t enforce strict private access by default.) ([Real Python][1])\n",
        "2. **Inheritance** – a class can inherit attributes/methods from another class, promoting reuse. ([Real Python][1])\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism** – the ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same base class/interface, or for methods to behave differently in subclasses. ([Real Python][1])\n",
        "4. **Abstraction** – exposing only the necessary features of objects while hiding the unnecessary complexity. ([Real Python][1])\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why use OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* It helps model real‐world entities (e.g., a Car class with attributes colour, speed; behaviours drive(), brake()). ([Real Python][1])\n",
        "* It improves code reuse (via classes/inheritance).\n",
        "* It helps structure and organise code, making maintenance easier. ([GeeksforGeeks][3])\n",

        "\n",
        "### Defining a class\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python you use the `class` keyword. Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here `Dog` is a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Creating (instantiating) an object\n",
        "\n",
        "You call the class as if it were a function to create an instance (object):\n",

        "Here `dog1` is an object (instance) of class `Dog`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `__init__()` – the constructor\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically you define an `__init__` method to initialise instance attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

        "* `self` refers to the instance being created.\n",
        "* `name` and `age` become instance attributes. ([GeeksforGeeks][3])\n",

        "```python\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    species = \"Canine\"   # class attribute (we’ll talk about this more later)\n",

        "Instance attributes are unique to each instance, typically defined in `__init__` or other instance methods by using `self`. Example above: `name`, `age`. ([GeeksforGeeks][5])\n",

        "* If you assign to `self.species` inside an instance, you will shadow (create) an instance attribute named `species`, thus not modifying the class attribute for others.\n",
