        "Dynamic binding (also called late binding) is the runtime association of a name or operation with the implementation that will be executed. In object-oriented code, dynamic binding typically means the selection of which method implementation to call is determined at runtime based on the actual class of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python this is the default: method calls and attribute accesses are resolved at runtime via the object’s class and the method resolution order.\n",

        "  4. If the attribute is a function object defined in the class, Python will create a *bound method* object by wrapping the function with the instance; this bound method holds a reference to the function object and the instance (so `bound_method.__self__` is the instance, `bound_method.__func__` is the function).\n",

        "* Descriptors are looked up on the class, not the instance; if a descriptor implements `__set__`, it is a data descriptor and takes precedence over instance attributes.\n",
        "* `__slots__` replaces the per-instance `__dict__` with a fixed set of attribute slots; this reduces memory per instance and prevents creation of new arbitrary attributes but prohibits some dynamic behavior.\n",
        "* Encapsulation is primarily by convention. The runtime still allows access to most internals (except that name mangling obscures but does not prevent access).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pros\n",
        "\n",
        "* Prevents accidental external modification of internal state.\n",

        "* Makes class invariants easier to maintain and debug.\n",
        "* `__slots__` can significantly reduce memory usage for large numbers of instances.\n",

        "## Cons\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python’s encapsulation is not absolute; determined code can access internals (via name mangling).\n",
        "* Overuse of private members complicates subclassing and testing.\n",
        "* `__slots__` limits flexibility (no `__dict__`, harder to add attributes at runtime; common pitfalls with multiple inheritance and slots).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best practices\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use single underscore `_name` to signal internal use.\n",
        "* Use `@property` for controlled access to fields rather than insisting on direct private fields.\n",
        "* Use double underscore `__name` only when you need to avoid name collision in subclasses; prefer composition if heavy protection is required.\n",
        "* Use `__all__` in modules to control public API; hide internals with `_` prefixed names.\n",
        "* Use `__slots__` when you need memory optimization and your class structure is stable.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Namespaces and frames**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Local variables live on the function frame (fast local array) or in closures (cells).\n",
        "   * Globals are stored in the module dictionary.\n",
        "   * Attribute lookups on objects use `__getattribute__` then `__getattr__` fallback.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Attribute lookup order**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * For `obj.attr`:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * If `attr` is found in the instance `__dict__` and it's not overridden by a data descriptor on the class, return it.\n",
        "     * Else, look at the class `__dict__` and then base classes following the MRO; if the found attribute is a descriptor, follow descriptor protocol.\n",
        "     * If not found, raise `AttributeError` or fallback to `__getattr__`.\n",

        "3. **Bound method object**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * When you access a function from a class on an instance, Python creates a bound method object that pairs the function and the instance. That object carries references that keep the instance alive for the call.\n",
