Since threads share memory (within the same process) in Python, they can use shared variables or objects—but naive sharing often leads to race conditions, deadlocks, or busy-waiting. Proper communication mechanisms avoid those pitfalls. ([TutorialsPoint][1])\n",

        "* **Wait–Notify / Signal**: With Condition or Event, a thread waits until some condition is met; another thread signals it.\n",
        "* **Producer-Consumer**: One or more producers generate data, one or more consumers consume. Use shared buffer + Condition or Queue.\n",
        "* **Shared state changes**: Threads monitor shared data; communication ensures they see consistent updates.\n",
        "* **Avoiding busy-waiting**: Instead of loops like `while not ready: pass`, use `wait()` to block efficiently.\n",
        "* **Avoiding missed signals**: If notify is called before wait, the waiting thread may never wake; so careful ordering and state checks matter.\n",
